# Kernel Trick I

## Deep Convolutional Representations in RKHS

## Goal üöÄ
> Fear not, those who delve into the maths of the kernel trick, for its advent in deep learning is coming.
> 
In this blog post, we focus on the Convolutional Kernel Network (CKN) architecture introduced in <d-cite key="mairal2016endtoend"></d-cite> and present its guiding principles and main components. This model opened a new line of research by demonstrating the benefits of the kernel trick for deep convolutional representations. For a more complete picture, we invite the reader to refer to the original paper <d-cite key="mairal2016endtoend"></d-cite>. 

## Kernel Trick
We provide below a simple definition of the kernel trick. For the interested reader, more details about the kernel trick can be found in <d-cite key="scholkopf2000kerneltrick"></d-cite> and the [slides](https://mva-kernel-methods.github.io/course-2023-2024/static_files/materials/slides.pdf) of [Julien Mairal](https://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/mairal/) and [Jean-Philippe Vert](https://jpvert.github.io/) contain all one needs to know about kernel methods. Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a high-dimensional feature space and $\phi\colon \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{H}$ a mapping. In the situation where inputs are first mapped to $\mathcal{H}$ with $\phi$ and then compared using the inner product $\langle \phi(x), \phi(x')\rangle_{\mathcal{H}}$, the kernel trick enables us to directly evaluate such pairwise comparison by kernel evaluation, i.e., 
$$K(x, x') = \langle \phi(x), \phi(x')\rangle_{\mathcal{H}}.$$

{% details :mag_right: More details on Kernels %}
Let us consider a set $\mathcal{X}$, a p.d. kernel $K : \mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}$, its associated RKHS $\mathcal{H}$ and its associated mapping fonction $\phi : \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb R$, i.e. the function such that $\forall x,x',~K(x,x') = \langle \phi(x),\phi(x') \rangle_{\mathcal{H}}$.

We recall below the notions of homogeneous dot product kernels that will be useful in the following. Let us consider some function $\kappa : \mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$. A dot product kernel is a p.d. kernel $K : \mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}$ defined as $$\forall x,x' \in \mathcal{X},~ K(x,x') = \kappa(\langle x,x'\rangle).$$
    We also define homogeneous dot product kernels as $$\forall x,x' \in \mathcal{X},~ K(x,x') = \lVert x \rVert\lVert x'\rVert \kappa \left(\left\langle \frac{x}{\lVert x \rVert},\frac{x'}{\lVert x'\rVert}\right\rangle\right).$$

If $\kappa$ has some regular properties (see <d-cite key="mairal2016endtoend"></d-cite>), we can use homogeneous dot product kernels to represent local image neighborhoods in $\mathcal{H}$.

A lot of these kernels exist, see <d-cite key="mairal2016endtoend"></d-cite> for details. These include the \textit{exponential} dot product kernel $K_{\exp}(x,y) = \text{e}^{\beta(\langle x,x'\rangle -1)} = \text{e}^{-\frac{\beta}{2}\lVert x-x' \rVert_2^2}$, where $\beta > 0$. When $\displaystyle\beta = \frac{1}{\sigma^2}$, we recover the well-known Gaussian Kernel. By the way, the arguments of the chosen kernels can be learned during model training!
{% enddetails %}

## 1. Convolutional Kernel Network in depth


### 1.1. Mathematical insights and computability
Kernel trick here, kernel trick there... But can we really compute this kernel trick in practice ?

Let us define mathematically an image as a mapping $I_0 : \Omega_0 \to \mathbb{R}^{3}$ (as an image has $3$ color channels). If $x$ and $x'$ are two patches extracted from $I_0$ we can get $\phi_1(x)$ and $\phi_1(x')$, their representation in $\mathcal{H}$, thanks to the kernel trick ! But, $\mathcal{H}$ is an ***infinite*** dimensional space, so how to deal with it in practice? :dizzy_face:

No panic, our friend Nystr√∂m is here to help! Nystr√∂m's method aims to approximate $\phi_1(x)$ and $\phi_1(x')$ by their projection $\psi_1(x)$ and $\psi_1(x')$ onto a ***finite*** dimensional subspace $\mathcal{F}$ (see the figure below).

{% include figure.html path="assets/img/blog_ckn/Nystrom.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-0" zoomable=true %}

The subspace $\mathcal{F}$ is defined as $\mathcal{F} = \text{span}(z_1,\dots,z_p)$, where $(z_i)_{i\in\{1\dots p\}}$ are anchor points, of unit-norm. $Z = \{z_1,\dots,z_p\}$ are the parameters of the layer in the sense that optimizing the layer means optimizing $\mathcal{F}$. The subspace $\mathcal{F}$ can be optimized in both a *supervised* (with backpropagation rules) or an *unsupervised* way (by minimzing projection residuals with spherical KMeans), see <d-cite key="mairal2016endtoend"></d-cite>.


### 3. The Convolutional Kernel Network


We can therefore construct our Convolutional Kernel Layer in three steps.

1. The idea is that we first extract patches $x$ from the image $I_0$. 

```python
def extract_2d_patches(self,x):
        h,w = self.filter_size
        batch_size, C, _, _ = x.shape
        unfolded_x = np.lib.stride_tricks.sliding_window_view(x, (batch_size, C, h, w))
        unfolded_x = unfolded_x.reshape(-1, self.patch_dim)
        return unfolded_x

def sample_patches(self, x_in, n_sampling_patches=1000):
        patches = self.extract_2d_patches(x_in)
        n_sampling_patches = min(patches.shape[0], n_sampling_patches)
        patches = patches[:n_sampling_patches]
        return patches
```

2. Then, we normalize and convolve them as $\lVert x \rVert\kappa\left(Z^\top \displaystyle\frac{x}{||x||}\right)$ and compute the approximation as $\psi(x) = \lVert x \rVert\kappa\left(Z^\top Z\right)^{-1/2}\kappa\left(Z^\top \displaystyle\frac{x}{||x||}\right)$ by applying the linear transform $\kappa\left(Z^\top Z\right)^{-1/2}$ at every pixel location,

```python
def conv_layer(self,x_in):
        patch_norm = np.sqrt(np.clip(conv2d_scipy(x_in**2,self.ones,bias=None,
                stride=1,padding=self.padding,dilation=self.dilation,
                groups=self.groups),a_min=EPS,a_max=None))
        x_out = conv2d_scipy(x_in, self.weight, self.bias,(1,1),
                        self.padding, self.dilation, self.groups)
        x_out = x_out / np.clip(patch_norm,a_min=EPS,a_max=None)
        x_out = patch_norm * self.kappa(x_out)
        return x_out
    
def mult_layer(self, x_in, lintrans):
        batch_size, in_c, H, W = x_in.shape
        x_out = np.matmul(
            np.tile(lintrans, (batch_size, 1, 1)), 
            x_in.reshape(batch_size, in_c, -1))
        return x_out.reshape(batch_size, in_c, H, W)
```

3. We can therefore compute the pooling operations. Note that gaussian linear pooling is defined as $$\displaystyle I_1(x) = \int_{x'\in\Omega_0} M_1(x') \text{e}^{-\beta\lVert x-x'\rVert_2^2}\text{d}x'$$ where $M_1$ is the "feature map" after the operation of step 2. That is why, we can interpret the pooling operation as a "convolution" operation.

```python
def pool_layer(self,x_in):
        if self.subsampling <= 1:
            return x_in
        x_out = conv2d_scipy(x_in, self.pooling_filter, bias=None, 
            stride=self.subsampling, padding=self.subsampling, 
            groups=self.out_channels)
        return x_out
```

Here's a global figure that summarizes all these operations, and thus the construction of a Convolutional Kernel Layer.

{% include figure.html path="assets/img/blog_ckn/CKN.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-0" zoomable=true %}

After these operations, we have constructed a "feature map" $I_1 : \Omega_1 \to \mathbb{R}^{p_1}$, that can be re-used. We can now build a **Convolutional Kernel Network** by stacking Convolutional Kernel Layers, and we will have a *representation* of the image at the output.

## 2. CNN vs. CKN

In <d-cite key="bietti2018group"></d-cite>, it is shown that CKNs contain a large class of CNNs with smooth homogeneous activation functions.

{% include figure.html path="assets/img/blog_ckn/CNN.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-0" zoomable=true %}

The similarities and differences between CKN and CNN are well illustrated in Figures~\ref{fig:CKN2} and \ref{fig:CNN}.

On the one hand, A CNN of $K$ layer can be represented by its output $f_{\text{CNN}}(x)$, if $x$ is the input, as :

$$f_{\text{CNN}}(x) = \gamma_K(\sigma_K(W_K\dots \gamma_2(\sigma_2(W_2\gamma_1(\sigma_1(W_1x))\dots))$$

where $(W_k)_k$ represent the convolution operations, $(\sigma_k)_k$ are pointwise non-linear functions, (e.g., ReLU), and $(\gamma_k)_k$ represent the pooling operations (see \cite{paulin2016convolutional}).

On the other hand, A CKN of $K$ layer can be represented by its output $f_{\text{CKN}}(x)$, if $x$ is the input, as :

$$f_{\text{CKN}}(x) = \gamma_K(\sigma_K(W_K(P_K\dots \gamma_2(\sigma_2(W_2(P_2(\gamma_1(\sigma_1(W_1(P_1(x))\dots))$$

where $(P_k)_k$ represent the patch extractions, $(W_k)_k$ the convolution operations, $(\sigma_k)_k$ the kernel operations (which allows us to learn non-linearity in the RKHS), and $(\gamma_k)_k$ the pooling operations.

## :desktop_computer: For the interesting reader

We provide an open-source implementation of the CKN architecture in pure numpy [here](https://github.com/ozekri/CKN_from_Scratch) to better understand how things work without having to read pages of documentation of modern deep learning framework such as `PyTorch`, `TensorFlow` or `JAX`. For practical usage, the original implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/claying/CKN-Pytorch-image). 

For any further questions, please feel free to contact the authors by mail!

We heartfully thank the professors of the [Kernel Methods course](https://mva-kernel-methods.github.io/course-2023-2024/) of the [MVA Master](https://www.master-mva.com/) : Prof. [Julien Mairal](https://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/mairal/), Prof. [Jean-Philippe Vert](https://jpvert.github.io/), Prof. [Michel Arbel](https://michaelarbel.github.io/), Prof. [Alessandro Rudi](https://www.di.ens.fr/~rudi/). A special mention to Prof. [Julien Mairal](https://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/mairal/) for proofreading this blog post !

## Equations

This theme supports rendering beautiful math in inline and display modes using [MathJax 3](https://www.mathjax.org/) engine.
You just need to surround your math expression with `$$`, like `$$ E = mc^2 $$`.
If you leave it inside a paragraph, it will produce an inline expression, just like $$ E = mc^2 $$.

To use display mode, again surround your expression with `$$` and place it as a separate paragraph.
Here is an example:

$$
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)
$$

Note that MathJax 3 is [a major re-write of MathJax](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/upgrading/whats-new-3.0.html) that brought a significant improvement to the loading and rendering speed, which is now [on par with KaTeX](http://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php).

## Citations

Citations are then used in the article body with the `<d-cite>` tag.
The key attribute is a reference to the id provided in the bibliography.
The key attribute can take multiple ids, separated by commas.

The citation is presented inline like this: <d-cite key="paulin2016convolutional"></d-cite> (a number that displays more information on hover).
If you have an appendix, a bibliography is automatically created and populated in it.

Distill chose a numerical inline citation style to improve readability of citation dense articles and because many of the benefits of longer citations are obviated by displaying more information on hover.
However, we consider it good style to mention author last names if you discuss something at length and it fits into the flow well‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâthe authors are human and it‚Äôs nice for them to have the community associate them with their work.

---

## Footnotes

Just wrap the text you would like to show up in a footnote in a `<d-footnote>` tag.
The number of the footnote will be automatically generated.<d-footnote>This will become a hoverable footnote.</d-footnote>

---

## Code Blocks

Syntax highlighting is provided within `<d-code>` tags.
An example of inline code snippets: `<d-code language="html">let x = 10;</d-code>`.
For larger blocks of code, add a `block` attribute:

<d-code block language="javascript">
  var x = 25;
  function(x) {
    return x * x;
  }
</d-code>

**Note:** `<d-code>` blocks do not look good in the dark mode.
You can always use the default code-highlight using the `highlight` liquid tag:

{% highlight javascript %}
var x = 25;
function(x) {
return x \* x;
}
{% endhighlight %}

---

## Interactive Plots

You can add interative plots using plotly + iframes :framed_picture:

<div class="l-page">
  <iframe src="{{ '/assets/plotly/demo.html' | relative_url }}" frameborder='0' scrolling='no' height="500px" width="100%" style="border: 1px dashed grey;"></iframe>
</div>

The plot must be generated separately and saved into an HTML file.
To generate the plot that you see above, you can use the following code snippet:

{% highlight python %}
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
df = pd.read_csv(
'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/earthquakes-23k.csv'
)
fig = px.density_mapbox(
df,
lat='Latitude',
lon='Longitude',
z='Magnitude',
radius=10,
center=dict(lat=0, lon=180),
zoom=0,
mapbox_style="stamen-terrain",
)
fig.show()
fig.write_html('assets/plotly/demo.html')
{% endhighlight %}

---

## Details boxes

Details boxes are collapsible boxes which hide additional information from the user. They can be added with the `details` liquid tag:

{% details Click here to know more %}
Additional details, where math $$ 2x - 1 $$ and `code` is rendered correctly.
{% enddetails %}

---

## Layouts

The main text column is referred to as the body.
It is the assumed layout of any direct descendants of the `d-article` element.

<div class="fake-img l-body">
  <p>.l-body</p>
</div>

For images you want to display a little larger, try `.l-page`:

<div class="fake-img l-page">
  <p>.l-page</p>
</div>

All of these have an outset variant if you want to poke out from the body text a little bit.
For instance:

<div class="fake-img l-body-outset">
  <p>.l-body-outset</p>
</div>

<div class="fake-img l-page-outset">
  <p>.l-page-outset</p>
</div>

Occasionally you‚Äôll want to use the full browser width.
For this, use `.l-screen`.
You can also inset the element a little from the edge of the browser by using the inset variant.

<div class="fake-img l-screen">
  <p>.l-screen</p>
</div>
<div class="fake-img l-screen-inset">
  <p>.l-screen-inset</p>
</div>

The final layout is for marginalia, asides, and footnotes.
It does not interrupt the normal flow of `.l-body` sized text except on mobile screen sizes.

<div class="fake-img l-gutter">
  <p>.l-gutter</p>
</div>

---

## Other Typography?

Emphasis, aka italics, with _asterisks_ (`*asterisks*`) or _underscores_ (`_underscores_`).

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or **underscores**.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
   ‚ãÖ‚ãÖ\* Unordered sub-list.
3. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
   ‚ãÖ‚ãÖ1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

‚ãÖ‚ãÖ‚ãÖYou can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

‚ãÖ‚ãÖ‚ãÖTo have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.‚ãÖ‚ãÖ
‚ãÖ‚ãÖ‚ãÖNote that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.‚ãÖ‚ãÖ
‚ãÖ‚ãÖ‚ãÖ(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

- Unordered list can use asterisks

* Or minuses

- Or pluses

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links.
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        |      Are      |  Cool |
| ------------- | :-----------: | ----: |
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      |   centered    |   $12 |
| zebra stripes |   are neat    |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

| Markdown | Less      | Pretty     |
| -------- | --------- | ---------- |
| _Still_  | `renders` | **nicely** |
| 1        | 2         | 3          |

> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can _put_ **Markdown** into a blockquote.

Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a _separate paragraph_.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the _same paragraph_.
