## Goal üöÄ 
> Fear not, those who delved into the maths of the kernel trick, for its advent in deep learning is coming.

In this blog post, we focus on the Convolutional Kernel Network (CKN) architecture introduced in <d-cite key="mairal2016endtoend"></d-cite> and present its guiding principles and main components. The CKN opened a new line of research in deep learning by demonstrating the benefits of the kernel trick for deep convolutional representations. For a more complete picture, we invite the reader to refer to the original paper <d-cite key="mairal2016endtoend"></d-cite>. 

## Kernel Trick üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
We briefly recall the definition of the kernel trick. Let $$\mathcal{H}$$ be a high-dimensional feature space and $$\varphi\colon \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{H}$$ a mapping. In the situation where inputs are first mapped to $$\mathcal{H}$$ with $$\varphi$$ and then compared using the inner product $$\langle \varphi(x), \varphi(x')\rangle_{\mathcal{H}}$$, the kernel trick enables us to directly evaluate such pairwise comparison by kernel evaluation, i.e.,

$$
\begin{equation*}
K(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}') = \langle \varphi(\mathbf{x}), \varphi(\mathbf{x}')\rangle_{\mathcal{H}}
\end{equation*}
$$

For the interested reader, more details can be found below or in <d-cite key="scholkopf2000kerneltrick"></d-cite>. In addition, the [slides](https://mva-kernel-methods.github.io/course-2023-2024/static_files/materials/slides.pdf) of [Julien Mairal](https://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/mairal/) and [Jean-Philippe Vert](https://jpvert.github.io/) contain all one needs to know about kernel methods.

{% details :mag_right: More details on Kernels %}
Let us consider a set $$\mathcal{X}$$, a p.d. kernel $$K : \mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}$$, its associated RKHS $$\mathcal{H}$$ and its associated mapping fonction $$\varphi : \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb R$$, i.e. the function such that $$\forall \mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}',~K(x,x') = \langle \varphi(\mathbf{x}),\varphi(\mathbf{x}') \rangle_{\mathcal{H}}$$.

In the rest of this post, we'll be talking about CKNs, which use a particular type of kernel, namely dots product kernels.
Let us consider some function $$\kappa : \mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$$. A dot product kernel is a p.d. kernel $$K : \mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}$$ defined as $$\forall \mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}' \in \mathcal{X},~ K(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}') = \kappa(\langle \mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}'\rangle).$$
We also define homogeneous dot product kernels as $$\forall \mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}' \in \mathcal{X},~ K(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}') = \lVert \mathbf{x} \rVert\lVert \mathbf{x}'\rVert \kappa \left(\left\langle \frac{\mathbf{x}}{\lVert \mathbf{x} \rVert},\frac{\mathbf{x}'}{\lVert \mathbf{x}'\rVert}\right\rangle\right).$$

If $$\kappa$$ has some regular properties (see <d-cite key="mairal2016endtoend"></d-cite>), we can use homogeneous dot product kernels to represent local image neighborhoods in $$\mathcal{H}$$.

A lot of these kernels exist, see <d-cite key="mairal2016endtoend"></d-cite> for details. These include the \textit{exponential} dot product kernel $$K_{\exp}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}') = \text{e}^{\beta(\langle \mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}'\rangle -1)} = \text{e}^{-\frac{\beta}{2}\lVert \mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}' \rVert_2^2}$$, where $$\beta > 0$$. When $$\displaystyle\beta = \frac{1}{\sigma^2}$$, we recover the well-known Gaussian Kernel. By the way, the arguments of the chosen kernels can be learned during model training!
{% enddetails %}

A direct and very popular application of the kernel trick is SVM. It allows us to map data points from an initial space to a more abstract RKHS. In this way, we can move into spaces in which the data is represented in a linearly separable way (by a hyperplane). Here's a short animation showing how the kernel trick can be used to map data initially contained in a 2D plane, to a larger space where they can be separated by a hyperplane.

Of course, kernel trick can be used for much more than that, and in this post, we propose to show you how you can play with convolutional representations using kernel trick.

## Convolutional Kernel Network in-depth üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### Mathematical insights and computability
Kernel trick here, kernel trick there... But can we really compute this kernel trick in practice ?

Let us define mathematically an image as a mapping $$I_0 : \Omega_0 \to \mathbb{R}^{3}$$ (as an image has $$3$$ color channels). If $$\mathbf{x}$$ and $$\mathbf{x}'$$ are two patches extracted from $$I_0$$ we can get $$\varphi_1(\mathbf{x})$$ and $$\varphi_1(\mathbf{x}')$$, their representation in $$\mathcal{H}$$, thanks to the kernel trick ! But, $$\mathcal{H}$$ is an ***infinite*** dimensional space, so how to deal with it in practice? :dizzy_face:

No panic, our friend Nystr√∂m is here to help! Nystr√∂m's method aims to approximate $$\varphi_1(\mathbf{x})$$ and $$\varphi_1(\mathbf{x}')$$ by their projection $$\psi_1(\mathbf{x})$$ and $$\psi_1(\mathbf{x}')$$ onto a ***finite*** dimensional subspace $$\mathcal{F}$$ (see the figure below).

{% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/blog_ckn/Nystrom.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-0" zoomable=true %}

The subspace $$\mathcal{F}$$ is defined as $$\mathcal{F} = \text{span}(z_1,\dots,z_p)$$, where $$(z_i)_{i\in\{1\dots p\}}$$ are anchor points, of unit-norm. $$Z = \{z_1,\dots,z_p\}$$ are the parameters of the layer in the sense that optimizing the layer means optimizing $$\mathcal{F}$$. The subspace $$\mathcal{F}$$ can be optimized in both a *supervised* (with backpropagation rules) or an *unsupervised* way (by minimzing projection residuals with spherical KMeans), see <d-cite key="mairal2016endtoend"></d-cite>.


### The Convolutional Kernel Network


We can therefore construct our Convolutional Kernel Layer in three steps.

- We extract patches $$\mathbf{x}$$ from the image $$I_0$$.
  <details>
    <summary>Code</summary>
    <pre><code class="language-python">def extract_2d_patches(self, x):
        h, w = self.filter_size
        batch_size, C, _, _ = x.shape
        unfolded_x = np.lib.stride_tricks.sliding_window_view(x, (batch_size, C, h, w))
        unfolded_x = unfolded_x.reshape(-1, self.patch_dim)
        return unfolded_x
  
    def sample_patches(self, x_in, n_sampling_patches=1000):
        patches = self.extract_2d_patches(x_in)
        n_sampling_patches = min(patches.shape[0], n_sampling_patches)
        patches = patches[:n_sampling_patches]
        return patches</code></pre></details>


- We normalize and convolve them as $$\lVert \mathbf{x} \rVert \kappa \left( Z^\top \displaystyle\frac{\mathbf{x}}{||\mathbf{x}||} \right)$$ and compute the approximation as $$\psi(x) = \lVert \mathbf{x} \rVert\kappa\left(Z^\top Z\right)^{-1/2}\kappa\left(Z^\top \displaystyle\frac{\mathbf{x}}{||\mathbf{x}||}\right)$$ by applying the linear transform $$\kappa\left(Z^\top Z\right)^{-1/2}$$ at every pixel location,
  <details>
    <summary>Code</summary>
    <pre><code class="language-python">def conv_layer(self, x_in):
        patch_norm = np.sqrt(np.clip(conv2d_scipy(x_in**2, self.ones, bias=None,
                stride=1, padding=self.padding, dilation=self.dilation,
                groups=self.groups), a_min=EPS, a_max=None))
        x_out = conv2d_scipy(x_in, self.weight, self.bias, (1,1),
                        self.padding, self.dilation, self.groups)
        x_out = x_out / np.clip(patch_norm, a_min=EPS, a_max=None)
        x_out = patch_norm * self.kappa(x_out)
        return x_out
  
    def mult_layer(self, x_in, lintrans):
        batch_size, in_c, H, W = x_in.shape
        x_out = np.matmul(
            np.tile(lintrans, (batch_size, 1, 1)), 
            x_in.reshape(batch_size, in_c, -1))
        return x_out.reshape(batch_size, in_c, H, W)</code></pre></details>


- We compute the pooling operations. Note that gaussian linear pooling is defined as

  $$
  \begin{equation*}
  \displaystyle I_1(x) = \int_{\mathbf{x}'\in\Omega_0} M_1(x') \text{e}^{-\beta\lVert \mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'\rVert_2^2}\text{d}\mathbf{x}'
  \end{equation*}
  $$
  
  where $$M_1$$ is the "feature map" after the second point operation. That is why, we can interpret the pooling operation as a "convolution" operation. <!-- RELIER $$M_1$$ √† $$\psi(x)$$ ET ECRIRE $$I_1$$ SOUS LA FORME D'UNE SOMME POUR QUE CE SOIT CONSISTENT AVEC CE QUI SE DIT PLUS LOIN AU MOMENT DES CONVOLUTIONS. -->
  <details>
    <summary>Code</summary>
    <pre><code class="language-python">def pool_layer(self, x_in):
        if self.subsampling <= 1:
            return x_in
        x_out = conv2d_scipy(x_in, self.pooling_filter, bias=None, 
            stride=self.subsampling, padding=self.subsampling, 
            groups=self.out_channels)
        return x_out</code></pre></details>


Here is a global figure that summarizes all these operations, and thus the construction of a Convolutional Kernel Layer.

{% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/blog_ckn/CKN.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-0" zoomable=true %}

After these operations, we have constructed a "feature map" $$I_1 : \Omega_1 \to \mathbb{R}^{p_1}$$, that can be re-used. We can now build a **Convolutional Kernel Network** by stacking Convolutional Kernel Layers, and we will have a *representation* of the image at the output.

## CNN vs. CKN ‚öîÔ∏è

### Overview

In <d-cite key="bietti2018group"></d-cite>, it is shown that CKNs contain a large class of CNNs with smooth homogeneous activation functions.

{% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/blog_ckn/CNN.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-0" zoomable=true %}

The similarities and differences between CKN and CNN are well illustrated in the two previous figures.

On the one hand, A CNN of $$K$$ layer can be represented by its output $$f_{\text{CNN}}(\mathbf{x})$$, if $$\mathbf{x}$$ is the input, as :

$$
\begin{equation*}
f_{\text{CNN}}(\mathbf{x}) = \gamma_K(\sigma_K(W_K\dots \gamma_2(\sigma_2(W_2\gamma_1(\sigma_1(W_1\mathbf{x}))\dots))
\end{equation*}
$$

where $$(W_k)_k$$ represent the convolution operations, $$(\sigma_k)_k$$ are pointwise non-linear functions, (e.g., ReLU), and $$(\gamma_k)_k$$ represent the pooling operations (see <d-cite key="paulin2016convolutional"></d-cite>).

On the other hand, A CKN of $$K$$ layer can be represented by its output $$f_{\text{CKN}}(\mathbf{x})$$, if $$\mathbf{x}$$ is the input, as :

$$
\begin{equation*}
f_{\text{CKN}}(\mathbf{x}) = \gamma_K(\sigma_K(W_K(P_K\dots \gamma_2(\sigma_2(W_2(P_2(\gamma_1(\sigma_1(W_1(P_1(\mathbf{x}))\dots))
\end{equation*}
$$

where $$(P_k)_k$$ represent the patch extractions, $$(W_k)_k$$ the convolution operations, $$(\sigma_k)_k$$ the kernel operations (which allows us to learn non-linearity in the RKHS), and $$(\gamma_k)_k$$ the pooling operations.

## Getting your hands dirty üñ•Ô∏è

We provide an open-source implementation of the CKN architecture in pure numpy [here](https://github.com/ozekri/CKN_from_Scratch) to better understand how things work without having to read pages of documentation of modern deep learning framework such as `PyTorch`, `TensorFlow` or `JAX`. For practical usage, the original implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/claying/CKN-Pytorch-image). 

### Stonage ML

### Challenges

#### Autodiff

#### Convolutional operations

Little-known fact: [`torch.conv2D`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Conv2d.html) computes a [cross-correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-correlation), not a [convolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution) (yeah, the name is confusing! :weary:). But what is the difference ? The discrete convolution operator $$\ast$$ between two functions $$g$$ and $$h$$ is defined as

$$
\begin{equation*}
(g \ast h)[n]=\sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty} g[m] h[n-m]
\end{equation*}
$$

whereas the discrete cross-correlation operator $$\circledast$$ is defined as

$$
\begin{equation*}
(g \circledast h)[n]=\sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty} \overline{g[m]} h[n+m]
\end{equation*}
$$

where $$\overline{g[m]}$$ denotes the complex conjugate of $$g[m]$$. It's subtle, but in the case of images, cross-correlation requires one less "image flipping" than convolution because of the minus sign in $$h[n-m]$$. Given the number of convolutions we're going to calculate, if we can spare ourselves an "image flip" each time, we'll do it! What's more, as the filter parameters are learnable, it doesn't matter if we choose cross-correlation rather than convolution.

That being said,
<!-- parler du linear pooling as convolution, parler du temps de calcul et transition vers la sous partie suivante parallelisation -->
