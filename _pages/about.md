This page was created by [Ambroise Odonnat](https://ambroiseodt.github.io/) and [Oussama Zekri](https://oussamazekri.fr) and will host blog posts about research, maths, and machine learning. In those posts, we will mostly discuss papers we love and believe are important. We will also present our research works and some mathematical tricks we use daily.
